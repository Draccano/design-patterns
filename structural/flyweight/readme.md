# ðŸ’¾ Flyweight (Space optimization)
S space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.

## Motivation 
- Avoid redundancy when storing data. E.g. MMORPG.
  - Plenty of users with identical first/last names. 
  - no sense in storing same first/last name over and over again.
  - Store a list of names and references to them.

E.g., bold or italic text formatting
    - Don't want each character to have a formatting character.
    - Operate on ranges (e.g. line number, start/end positions).

## Summary
Store common data externally. Specify an index or reference into the external data store. Define the idea of "ranges" on homogeneuous collections and store data related to the those ranges.
