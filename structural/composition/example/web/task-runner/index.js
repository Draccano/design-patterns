/**
 * Task Runner. ðŸ¤–
 * We feed this Task Runner a set of 'Task Instructions'. 
 * But each 'Task Instruction' may have 'Sub Task Instructions', 
 * and each Sub Task Instruction might have it's own 'Sub Task Instructions'.
 * 
 * We can see already that this has the potential for 
 * being a recursive structure.
 * 
 * We don't necessarily want the 'Task Runner' to have to check at each execution 
 * of each 'Instruction' if it is 'Composite Instruction Set' or a 'Single Instruction'.
 * 
 * The Composite Instruction Set should contain a list of children of either 
 * Composite Instruction Set or Single Instruction that the Task Runner 
 * doesn't need to know about.
 * 
 * Therefore, to tackle this, we would define a common Instruction interface 
 * containing an execute() method that the Composite Instruction Set 
 * and the Single Instruction implement.
 * 
 * The Task Runner will Iterate through a list of Instructions 
 * calling the execute() method.
 * 
 * Single Instructions will execute their custom logic, whilst 
 * Composite Instruction Sets will Iterate through their children 
 * and call their execute() method.
 * 
 * They don't need to know if their children are Composite or Single Instructions,
 *  and the Task Runner also does not need to know the concrete makeup of
 *  the Instructions it needs to run, allowing for a lot of flexibility!
