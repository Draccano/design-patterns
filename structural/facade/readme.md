# 📏 Facade
Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large sophisticated body of code.
Balancing complexity and presentation/usability. For example home.
    - Many subsystems (electrical, sanitation),
    - Complex internal structure (e.g. floor layers)
    - End user is not exposed to internals.

Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes. May allow users to escalate to use more comples APIs if they need to.
